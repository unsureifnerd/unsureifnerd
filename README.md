### 👋 About Me
I’m not the productivity poster child. I procrastinate, lose momentum, and restart things way too often. And to be clear: I’m **not** a programmer — I actually dislike coding. I only touch it when I have to, usually for something small or useful. I tinker with ideas, build things in messy bursts, and learn in a slow, scattered way. Lazy, yes — but not totally lost. I just prefer doing things on my own terms.

### 🛠 What I Actually Do
- Start projects, abandon them, revive them, and repeat  
- Learn tech only when it feels worth it  
- Build tiny tools/apps out of necessity, not passion  
- Question everything before committing  
- Gravitate toward simple, remote-friendly, flexible paths

### 💭 How I Think
I’m skeptical by default. I don’t care about hype or hustle culture. I like practical solutions that actually solve problems. My progress isn’t fast, but it’s real — just not pretty or linear.

### 🌱 What I’m Trying To Improve
Consistency. That’s the biggest gap.  
Also clarity, finishing what I start, and focusing on things that actually matter.

### 🧩 What to Expect From Me
Not a coder. Not a productivity machine.  
Just someone figuring things out slowly, testing ideas, and trying to get slightly less lazy over time.

### 📝 Closing Note
I can’t think of more to write.

*(And yes, I didn’t even write this myself — AI did. I was too lazy.)*
